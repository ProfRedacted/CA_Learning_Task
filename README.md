Elementary cellular automata are one-dimensional, discrete mathematical models consisting of a line of cells, each with a binary state, and evolve through discrete time steps based on simple local rules. These rules, often represented by a binary number, determine the state transitions of each cell based on its current state and the states of its neighbors, leading to diverse and complex patterns emerging over time.

Steps:
1) Install pygame using "pip install pygame"
2) Run the program
3) Select the starting column by clicking any part of the column
4) Press Space to play the program

Features 
- Main Menu
- Custom rules
- pause and play the simulation by pressing the space bar
- reset the board to try out a new starting state by pressing "R" key
- randomly generate a starting state by pressing "G" key

This is the definition for the Elementary CA
CA = { L^1, (0, 1) , (pattern of L,C,R), Rules:{user input}
    }
